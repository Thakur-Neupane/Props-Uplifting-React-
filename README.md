#User List Project 
## In this project you can simply add the users and display them in the table.
###My approaches:
The project has been simply made on vite and npm ecosystem.
Bootstrap has been used for CSS.
The user and table components are made.
The controlled components are learned on form component.
The datas are stored in state.
The states are uplifted.
The userdata from form is uplifted to app.jsx and then it is passed down to the table component to display it.
The conditional rendering is done for male and female avatars based on gender and the color of their name text is also changed on the gender basis.

##Use 
For your study simply download the folder and install npm install. After npm ecosystem is installed simply type npm run dev. The project will go live.

##Deployment 
The project is deployed at Vercel. https://props-uplifting-react.vercel.app/
