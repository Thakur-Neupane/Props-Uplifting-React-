# User List Project 
## In this project you can simply add the users and display them in the table.
### My approaches:
1 The project has been simply made on vite and npm ecosystem.  

2 Bootstrap has been used for CSS.

3 The user and table components are made.

4 The controlled components are learned on form component.

5 The datas are stored in state.

6 The states are uplifted.

7 The userdata from form is uplifted to app.jsx and then it is passed down to the table component to display it.

8 The conditional rendering is done for male and female avatars based on gender and the color of their name text is also changed on the gender basis.

##Use 
For your study simply download the folder and install npm install. After npm ecosystem is installed simply type npm run dev. The project will go live.

##Deployment 
The project is deployed at Vercel. https://props-uplifting-react.vercel.app/
